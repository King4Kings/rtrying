After the pattern execution - expected cars allocation was 9 - but 10 cars are allocated.
Rounding off issue is there - Rounding off should be done as per Limit as well. If Limit is reached the rounding off should not be done for upper limit it seems. Please check.

In Case-2 (2. By N month Order Ratio)
As per the ratio calculation - again 9 cars would have been allocated, But total 10 are getting allocated.
This is not rounding off issue - the allocation of each color itself was incorrect (As shown in the attached screen shot) - The expected and actual Allocation done - both are shown. Please check.

2.If any upload file contains :
I.Duplicate feature code but ocf frame code of that duplicate feature as well as corresponding feature Description is not matching with master.
II.Also in above case Car Group is not matching with Car Series for above record in master.

Actual:Actually no error shown and above record is uploaded alongwith modified data.
Expected:Relevent error should be shown in above cases.
--PFA sheet 376 used for uploading
3.Mandatory error messages are not shown on click of Update Button.They are shown after uploading file or on closing file selection window.They should be shown on click of Update button.

4.If production month format is tempered in Excel then also upload is successfull.For ex. instead of 2016-06(N+4) ,user uploads 2016-07(N+4+1).
So production month validations should be performed.

5.Values should not be modified for grayed out record after upload.

6.Junk Characters are displayed for ""Cancel"" button text on popup ""Do you want to update the Buyer Group Level OCF limit to unlimited ?"".Also in this case if upload is cancelled by user then """"Upload cancelled by the user""  message should be shown on screen.

7.When more than 7 digits ocf limit qty  is uploaded then grid is shown blank from next prod months onwards  for all features as well as for that specific prod month for that feature. So,in this case appropriate error message should be shown.

8.While upload operation is in progress, user should be notified about this. Since, currently user does not come to know what is happening on screen after upload button is clicked.

1. Data Extraction for Process 2.1 if Plant_Line_Summary = Y
   Data is not extracting successfully. 
Reason : Production Day No in Daily OCF Limit Trn table, Data type is Char(2). While passing Prod_Day_No = '1', Condition is not satisfied and failed to extract the record and batch is getting stopped.

Query:

SELECT DISTINCT SUM(OCF_LMT_QTY), PROD_MNTH , PROD_WK_NO ,  CAR_SRS ,OCF_REGION_CD ,  OCF_BUYER_GRP_CD ,FEAT_CD ,OCF_FRME_CD  ,length(LINE_CLASS) , 
length(PROD_PLNT_CD) , length(PROD_DAY_NO)  from TRN_DAILY_OCF_LMT
  where  CONCAT(PROD_MNTH,PROD_WK_NO) >= '2015112'  
  and POR_CD = '91'  and OCF_REGION_CD = 'G'  and
  PROD_PLNT_CD = '10'  and LINE_CLASS = '6000'  and

2. In Process 2.1, we have condition (If OCF_Region_CD_Batch_Input_Parameter is Not Null). 
   So, my understanding is, we can execute the batch with or without passing Input parameter OCF_Region_CD.
   While executing the batch without OCF_Region_CD, batch stopped. Requesting for OCF_Region CD.

  1. End Item Comparison report
   2. Production Order Vol report 

In requirement document and in current implementation also , its specified that 
    1 End Item Comparison report is created using MONTHLY PRODUCTION ORDER TRN data and MONTHLY PRODUCTION SCHEDULE TRN data.
    2 Production Order Vol report is created using MONTHLY PRODUCTION ORDER TRN data.

 


 But as you know, Monthly Production Order data(which is sent to plan) is first created and transmitted at the timing of Final Order (#1)
    And Monthly Production Schedule data is first received after  the  Final Order#2 completion. 
 
Confirmation Point is :
   So this screen reports will be generated only after Final Order 1 and Final order 2 respectively if we follow above logic.
   But we ( myself,Mohan) think that these reports will be created using User inputted Orders ie. MonthlyOrderTransaction data.
   So we confirmed with GSV regarding same but as they are also not sure, Imai san told us to check data source of these reports from NMT,NMIPL OTD JPlans system.
    Same data source need to be used in Dragon also.
    
Can you comment regarding above confirmation point if you know already or can you please check NMT,NMIPL OTD JPlans system to confirm this point. 
You can refer my communication with Imaisan in below mail trail if required.

Actual bahaviour:
 - For the Buyer group and Car series selected - the Horizon was set to Full. Batch B000020 was executed.

 - Screen result and DB result are mismatching - Screen message says batch executed successfully. DB says batch failed with error. To identify it is difficult that because of Horizon batch failed.
In the log file message says - No such buyer group found - hence batch stopped with error.
Please find the attached log file.

Expectation: 
1. If Batch is executed, it should complete without affecting the order values for those buyer group whose horizon is set to Full. 
OR 
it should give proper error message telling Full Horizon is set, because of which this batch cannot be executed.

(1)MST_OEI_BUYER_PERIOD
As far as I can see in the MST_OEI_BUYER_PERIOD, we don?t have any records in MST_OEI_BUYER_PERIOD.
MST_OEI_BUYER_PERIOD is related to the Oder Taka Base Month Condition in P0002.2 & P0002.3 for B000005.
In my opinion, MN Adot. Date & Max Abolish Date are required in MST_OEI_BUYER_PERIOD.

(2)ORDER_TAKE BASE MONTH between Monthly & Weekly
I find the period gap between the Monthly & weekly.
Do we need to synchronize both monthly and weekly?

According to the Basic Design's ""Note 1"" sheet, following points are different between actual and design.

1.
Design:
OSEI FROZEN MASTER should be related to OSEI MASTER by OSEI ID and month.

Actual:
OSEI FROZEN MASTER is related to OSEI MASTER by only month.
So if even one frozen record exists, all OSEI will be frozen in the month.

2.
Design:
Production months after Order Take Base Month should be target.

Actual:
Production month same to Order Take Base Month will be target."
